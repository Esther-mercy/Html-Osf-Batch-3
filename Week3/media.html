            <h1>The greenhouse effect</h1>
The average surface temperature of Earth is maintained by a balance of various forms of solar and terrestrial
 radiation. Solar radiation is often called “shortwave” radiation because the frequencies of the radiation are
  relatively high and the wavelengths relatively short—close to the visible portion of the electromagnetic 
  spectrum. Terrestrial radiation, on the other hand, is often called “longwave” radiation because the frequencies
   are relatively low and the wavelengths relatively long—somewhere in the infrared part of the spectrum.
    Downward-moving solar energy is typically measured in watts per square metre. The energy of the total 
    incoming solar radiation at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (the so-called “solar constant”) amounts roughly
     to 1,366 watts per square metre annually. Adjusting for the fact that only one-half of the planet’s 
     surface receives solar radiation at any given time, the average surface insolation is 342 watts per
      square metre annually.

The amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface is only a small fraction of the total solar radiation
 entering the atmosphere. For every 100 units of incoming solar radiation, roughly 30 units are reflected back
  to space by either clouds, the atmosphere, or reflective regions of Earth’s surface. This reflective capacity
   is referred to as Earth’s planetary albedo, and it need not remain fixed over time, since the spatial extent
    and distribution of reflective formations, such as clouds and ice cover, can change. The 70 units of solar
     radiation that are not reflected may be absorbed by the atmosphere, clouds, or the surface. In the absence
      of further complications, in order to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium, Earth’s surface and atmosphere
       must radiate these same 70 units back to space.
