            <p>
                Global warming refers to the increase in the planet’s overall average temperature in recent decades. 
                Natural processes have always affected Earth’s temperature and climate, but more recently, the planet’s
                 temperature and climate have changed at a higher pace than nature alone can explain.
                  These rapid changes are due to human activities and the widespread use of fossil fuels for energy.
        Fossil fuels include coal, oil and natural gas. Burning fossil fuels causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect”
         in Earth’s atmosphere. The greenhouse effect happens when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere,
          and the Earth’s surface reflects that heat. Some of the gasses in the atmosphere then trap heat over Earth.
           Gasses emitted by the burning of fossil fuels are very good at trapping heat and preventing it from leaving
            the atmosphere.

            <p>What causes global warming?
                Global warming results from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere. This trapped energy comes from incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated back into the atmosphere as infrared energy. 
                
                Though natural cycles and fluctuations have caused the planet's climate to change continually over the last 800,000 years, it is human activity that has driven our current era of global warming. In particular, our burning of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, gasoline, and natural gas—has led to the greenhouse effect. In the United States, the largest source of greenhouse gases is transportation, followed closely by electricity production and industrial activity. (Learn about the natural and human causes of climate change.)
                
                To support global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the United States now faces the monumental (yet achievable) task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero no later than 2050. We must also fulfill our commitments to help developing nations meet their climate goals—a responsibility that we (and other rich, polluting nations) are currently falling short on. In better news, at the most recent United Nations climate convention, countries agreed to work toward scaling up climate finance to developing countries to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.
